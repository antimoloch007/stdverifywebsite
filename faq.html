                <div class="faq-question">Does STD Verify store my test results?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>No, STD Verify does not store your actual test results. We use a secure verification system that only confirms your testing status without storing the sensitive details of your medical records. Our platform utilizes advanced cryptographic methods to verify your status while keeping your specific medical information private.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">How does STD Verify work?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>STD Verify is a tool that allows you to verify your STD results securely and privately. In our beta, you'll upload a copy of your STD results. We do not store your results or your name, and we delete your upload after verification. Instead, we record a true or false value to determine if you uploaded a valid document that shows negative results for STDs. We then use a zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) to compute a proof that your results have been validated.</p>
                    <p>When you want to display your results using our app, a virtual machine will run the proof that validates your results trustlessly and anonymously.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">What are zero-knowledge proofs?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Zero-knowledge proofs are a cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself. At STD Verify, we use zero-knowledge proofs to verify your testing status without storing or sharing your actual test results. This advanced technology enables us to confirm you've been tested recently and what your status is without ever having access to your detailed medical information.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">Are you HIPAA compliant?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, STD Verify is fully HIPAA compliant. We've designed our platform from the ground up to meet and exceed all requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Our security protocols, data handling procedures, and verification processes are regularly audited to ensure full compliance with healthcare privacy regulations.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>STD Verify is a secure platform that allows individuals to verify and share their STD status. Our service enables users to upload their test results from certified healthcare providers, which we then verify and make available through our secure system. Users can then choose to share their verified status with potential partners through our mobile app or at participating venues.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">Is my health information secure and private?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely. We take your privacy extremely seriously. Your health information is encrypted and stored securely following HIPAA guidelines. You have complete control over who can view your status. We never share your detailed health information with third parties, and we only display your verification status (not specific test results) when you choose to share it.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">Which STDs are covered in the verification?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Our standard verification covers the most common STDs, including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and hepatitis. We're continuously expanding our coverage based on healthcare recommendations and community needs. You can choose which test results to include in your verification profile.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">How often should I update my STD verification?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Healthcare professionals recommend STD testing every 3-6 months for sexually active individuals, especially those with multiple partners. Our system clearly displays when your last verification was performed, and we send reminders when it's time to get tested again. Keeping your verification current is an important part of responsible sexual health.</p>
